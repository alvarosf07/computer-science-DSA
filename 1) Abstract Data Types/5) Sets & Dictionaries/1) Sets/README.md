# Sets

<p>  A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. </p> 

<p> In Python, curly braces <code>{}</code> or the <code>set()</code> function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use <code>set()</code, not <code>{}</code>; the latter creates an empty dictionary.</p>
