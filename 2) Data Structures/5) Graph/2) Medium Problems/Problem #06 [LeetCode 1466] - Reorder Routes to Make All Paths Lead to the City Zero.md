# [LeetCode 1466 - Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero)


## Description

<p>There are <code>n</code> cities numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code> and <code>n - 1</code> roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.</p>

<p>Roads are represented by <code>connections</code> where <code>connections[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents a road from city <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> to city <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<p>This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city <code>0</code>), and many people want to travel to this city.</p>

<p>Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city <code>0</code>. Return the <strong>minimum</strong> number of edges changed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <strong>guaranteed</strong> that each city can reach city <code>0</code> after reorder.</p>

## Solution 1 - DFS

The route map given in the problem has $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges. If we ignore the direction of the edges, then these $n$ nodes form a tree. The problem requires us to change the direction of some edges so that each node can reach node $0$.

We might as well consider starting from node $0$ and reaching all other nodes. The direction is opposite to the problem description, which means that when we build the graph, for the directed edge $[a, b]$, we should regard it as the directed edge $[b, a]$. That is to say, if it is from $a$ to $b$, we need to change the direction once; if it is from $b$ to $a$, no direction change is needed.

Next, we only need to start from node $0$, search all other nodes, and during the process, if we encounter an edge that needs to change direction, we accumulate the number of direction changes once.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the problem.

class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(a: int, fa: int) -> int:
            return sum(c + dfs(b, a) for b, c in g[a] if b != fa)

        g = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for a, b in connections:
            g[a].append((b, 1))
            g[b].append((a, 0))
        return dfs(0, -1)
```
#### JAVA:
```java
