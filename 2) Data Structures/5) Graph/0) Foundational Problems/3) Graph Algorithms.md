# Graph Most Common Algorithms
 Some of the most common algorithms with graphs that are often asked in coding interviews include:

| Algorithm                         | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Depth-First Search (DFS)          | Traversing through the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.    |
| Breadth-First Search (BFS)        | Traversing through the graph by exploring neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on.     |
| Shortest Path Algorithms          | Finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm. |
| Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)       | Finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph, often implemented with Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm. |
| Topological Sorting               | Sorting the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for any directed edge uv, vertex u comes before vertex v. |
| Cycle Detection                   | Detecting cycles in a graph, which can be solved using DFS or Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.       |
| Connectivity Components           | Finding the connected components in an undirected graph, typically implemented with DFS or BFS.       |
| Graph Coloring                    | Coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.              |
| Minimum Cut                        | Finding the minimum cut in a graph, commonly solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or Karger's algorithm. |
| Strongly Connected Components (SCC)| Finding strongly connected components in a directed graph using Tarjan's algorithm or Kosaraju's algorithm. |
| Bipartite Graph Check             | Determining if a graph is bipartite, meaning its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects vertices from different sets. |
| Eulerian Path/Cycle               | Finding whether a graph has an Eulerian path or cycle, and if so, finding one.                         |
| Hamiltonian Path/Cycle            | Finding whether a graph has a Hamiltonian path or cycle, and if so, finding one.                      |
