| Algorithm                   | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insertion                   | Inserting key-value pairs into the hash map.                                                            |
| Lookup                      | Looking up a value associated with a given key in the hash map.                                         |
| Deletion                    | Removing a key-value pair from the hash map.                                                            |
| Collision Handling          | Implementing strategies to handle collisions, such as chaining (using linked lists) or open addressing. |
| Resizing                    | Dynamically resizing the hash map to maintain a low load factor and efficient performance.              |
| Iteration                   | Iterating over all key-value pairs in the hash map.                                                     |
| Key Existence Check         | Checking if a key exists in the hash map.                                                               |
| Value Existence Check       | Checking if a value exists in the hash map.                                                             |
| Load Factor Management      | Monitoring and managing the load factor to ensure optimal performance.                                  |
| Hash Function Optimization  | Optimizing the hash function to distribute keys evenly across the hash map and reduce collisions.       |
