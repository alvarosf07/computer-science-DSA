# Implementations with Hash Maps
Several Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Data Structures (DS) are commonly implemented using hash maps:

### Abstract Data Types (ADTs) Implemented with Hash Maps:
  * **Sets -** A set is a collection of distinct elements where each element is unique. Hash maps can be used to implement sets by associating each element with a key in the hash map, effectively storing only the unique elements and allowing for fast membership tests and operations such as insertion, deletion, and intersection.
  * **Dictionaries -** Dictionaries are data structures that stores key-value pairs. They can be understood as an abstraction of hash maps. A dictionary uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables offer fast access (typically O(1) time complexity) to stored elements, making them efficient for lookups, insertions, and deletions in many applications.

### Other Structures implemented with Hash Maps:
  * **Counters -** A counter is a data structure that keeps track of the frequency of elements in a collection. Hash maps can be used to implement counters by associating each unique element with its count (frequency) in the hash map. This allows for efficient counting of occurrences and manipulation of element frequencies.
  * **Caches -** Caches are used to store frequently accessed or recently used data items to reduce access latency. Hash maps can be used to implement caches by storing key-value pairs, where the keys represent the data items and the values represent their corresponding cached values. This allows for fast retrieval and update of cached data.
