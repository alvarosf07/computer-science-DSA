# Tree Most Common Algorithms
 Some of the most common algorithms with trees that are often asked in coding interviews include:

| Algorithm                          | Description                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tree Traversal                     | Traversing through the nodes of a tree to visit each node exactly once in a specific order.               |
| Depth-First Search (DFS)           | Exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking to explore other branches.             |
| Breadth-First Search (BFS)         | Exploring neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.        |
| Binary Tree Properties             | Understanding and leveraging properties of binary trees like completeness, balancedness, or fullness.     |
| Binary Search Tree (BST)           | Implementing and operating on binary search trees, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.  |
| Lowest Common Ancestor             | Finding the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.                                         |
| Tree Diameter                      | Calculating the diameter (longest path between any two nodes) of a binary tree.                           |
| Binary Tree Serialization          | Serializing and deserializing a binary tree into a string or an array and vice versa.                     |
| Tree Reconstruction                | Reconstructing a binary tree from its traversal sequences (preorder, inorder, postorder).                 |
| Binary Tree Level Order Traversal  | Traversing the nodes of a binary tree level by level, starting from the root.                             |
| Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal | Traversing the nodes of a binary tree level by level, alternating the direction of each level.      |
| Binary Tree Inorder Successor      | Finding the inorder successor of a given node in a binary tree.                                           |
| Tree Isomorphism                   | Determining if two trees are isomorphic (having the same shape but not necessarily the same data).        |
