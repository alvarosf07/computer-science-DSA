# [1) Heap Implementation & Main Operations - Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/min-heap-in-python/)
A Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller (bigger) than or equal to the values in the children of that node. 

Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored at index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2 for 0 based indexing and for 1 based indexing the left child will be at 2k and right child will be at 2k + 1.

### 1.1) Operations on Min Heap
* `getMin()` : It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
* `extractMin()`: Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
* `insert()` : Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

### 1.2) Heap Implementation (using heapq library)
Normally, the library heapq is used to implement Heaps in Python. By default Min Heap is implemented by this class. 

```python
# Python3 program to demonstrate working of heapq 

from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop 

# Creating empty heap 
heap = [] 
heapify(heap) 

# Adding items to the heap using heappush function 
heappush(heap, 10) 
heappush(heap, 30) 
heappush(heap, 20) 
heappush(heap, 400) 

# printing the value of minimum element 
print("Head value of heap : "+str(heap[0])) 

# printing the elements of the heap 
print("The heap elements : ") 
for i in heap: 
	print(i, end = ' ') 
print("\n") 

element = heappop(heap) 

# printing the elements of the heap 
print("The heap elements : ") 
for i in heap: 
	print(i, end = ' ') 

```

### 1.3) Min-Heap Implementation
```python
# Python3 implementation of Min Heap 

import sys 

class MinHeap: 

	def __init__(self, maxsize): 
		self.maxsize = maxsize 
		self.size = 0
		self.Heap = [0]*(self.maxsize + 1) 
		self.Heap[0] = -1 * sys.maxsize 
		self.FRONT = 1

	# Function to return the position of 
	# parent for the node currently 
	# at pos 
	def parent(self, pos): 
		return pos//2

	# Function to return the position of 
	# the left child for the node currently 
	# at pos 
	def leftChild(self, pos): 
		return 2 * pos 

	# Function to return the position of 
	# the right child for the node currently 
	# at pos 
	def rightChild(self, pos): 
		return (2 * pos) + 1

	# Function that returns true if the passed 
	# node is a leaf node 
	def isLeaf(self, pos): 
		return pos*2 > self.size 

	# Function to swap two nodes of the heap 
	def swap(self, fpos, spos): 
		self.Heap[fpos], self.Heap[spos] = self.Heap[spos], self.Heap[fpos] 

	# Function to heapify the node at pos 
	def minHeapify(self, pos): 

		# If the node is a non-leaf node and greater 
		# than any of its child 
		if not self.isLeaf(pos): 
			if (self.Heap[pos] > self.Heap[self.leftChild(pos)] or
			self.Heap[pos] > self.Heap[self.rightChild(pos)]): 

				# Swap with the left child and heapify 
				# the left child 
				if self.Heap[self.leftChild(pos)] < self.Heap[self.rightChild(pos)]: 
					self.swap(pos, self.leftChild(pos)) 
					self.minHeapify(self.leftChild(pos)) 

				# Swap with the right child and heapify 
				# the right child 
				else: 
					self.swap(pos, self.rightChild(pos)) 
					self.minHeapify(self.rightChild(pos)) 

	# Function to insert a node into the heap 
	def insert(self, element): 
		if self.size >= self.maxsize : 
			return
		self.size+= 1
		self.Heap[self.size] = element 

		current = self.size 

		while self.Heap[current] < self.Heap[self.parent(current)]: 
			self.swap(current, self.parent(current)) 
			current = self.parent(current) 

	# Function to print the contents of the heap 
	def Print(self): 
		for i in range(1, (self.size//2)+1): 
			print(" PARENT : "+ str(self.Heap[i])+" LEFT CHILD : "+
								str(self.Heap[2 * i])+" RIGHT CHILD : "+
								str(self.Heap[2 * i + 1])) 

	# Function to build the min heap using 
	# the minHeapify function 
	def minHeap(self): 

		for pos in range(self.size//2, 0, -1): 
			self.minHeapify(pos) 

	# Function to remove and return the minimum 
	# element from the heap 
	def remove(self): 

		popped = self.Heap[self.FRONT] 
		self.Heap[self.FRONT] = self.Heap[self.size] 
		self.size-= 1
		self.minHeapify(self.FRONT) 
		return popped 

# Driver Code 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
	
	print('The minHeap is ') 
	minHeap = MinHeap(15) 
	minHeap.insert(5) 
	minHeap.insert(3) 
	minHeap.insert(17) 
	minHeap.insert(10) 
	minHeap.insert(84) 
	minHeap.insert(19) 
	minHeap.insert(6) 
	minHeap.insert(22) 
	minHeap.insert(9) 
	minHeap.minHeap() 

	minHeap.Print() 
	print("The Min val is " + str(minHeap.remove()))
