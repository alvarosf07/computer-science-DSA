# Implementations with Trees
Several Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Data Structures (DS) are commonly implemented using trees:

### Abstract Data Types (ADTs) Implemented with Hash Maps:
  * **Priority Queues -** A set is a collection of distinct elements where each element is unique. Hash maps can be used to implement sets by associating each element with a key in the hash map, effectively storing only the unique elements and allowing for fast membership tests and operations such as insertion, deletion, and intersection.
  * **Dictionaries -** Dictionaries are data structures that stores key-value pairs. They can be understood as an abstraction of hash maps. A dictionary uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables offer fast access (typically O(1) time complexity) to stored elements, making them efficient for lookups, insertions, and deletions in many applications.

### Other Structures implemented with Hash Maps:
  * **Binary Search Algorithms -** A counter is a data structure that keeps track of the frequency of elements in a collection. Hash maps can be used to implement counters by associating each unique element with its count (frequency) in the hash map. This allows for efficient counting of occurrences and manipulation of element frequencies.

The main abstract data structures in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that are commonly implemented using trees are:

Binary Trees: A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are used for various purposes, including binary search trees (BSTs), expression trees, and Huffman trees.

Binary Search Trees (BSTs): A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree where the elements are stored in a sorted order. For any node in the tree, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's value. BSTs are used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Balanced Trees: Balanced trees are binary search trees where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is minimized. Common types of balanced trees include AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees. These trees maintain balance to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations in worst-case scenarios.

Heaps: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are typically implemented as binary trees, such as binary max heaps or binary min heaps, where each node satisfies the heap property with respect to its parent and children. Heaps are commonly used in priority queues and heap sort algorithms.

Tries (Prefix Trees): A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings or keys where each node represents a common prefix of its children. Tries are commonly used in string-related problems, such as autocomplete systems and dictionary implementations.

These abstract data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and are widely used in various applications and algorithms. Trees provide efficient storage and retrieval of data, hierarchical organization, and support for a wide range of operations, making them essential in many scenarios in computer science and software engineering.
