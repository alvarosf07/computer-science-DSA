# Array Most Common Algorithms
 Some of the most common algorithms with arrays that are often asked in coding interviews include:

 <br/>

| Algorithm                   | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Array Traversal             | Simple traversal through an array to perform some operation on each element.                          |
| Two Pointers Technique      | Utilizing two pointers (indices) to efficiently solve problems like finding pairs with a given sum.   |
| Sliding Window Technique    | Maintaining a subarray of fixed size while traversing the array to solve problems like finding maximum sum subarray. |
| Counting Occurrences        | Counting the occurrences of elements in an array or counting the frequency of characters in a string. |
| Finding Duplicates/Missing Elements | Solving problems that involve finding duplicate elements or missing elements in an array.           |
| Finding Maximum/Minimum Element     | Finding the maximum or minimum element in an array, along with its index.                             |
| Subarray Problems           | Solving problems related to subarrays, such as finding maximum subarray sum or longest increasing subsequence. |
| Prefix Sum Technique        | Precomputing prefix sums to efficiently answer queries about subarrays, such as finding sum of elements in a given range. |
| Array Partitioning          | Partitioning an array into two parts based on a certain condition, like odd/even elements or positive/negative elements. |
| Rotation of Arrays          | Implementing algorithms to rotate an array by a given number of elements, either left or right.      |
| Searching Algorithms        | Implementing searching algorithms like Linear Search or Binary Search to find an element in an array. |
| Sorting Algorithms          | Implementing sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort to sort arrays.            |
