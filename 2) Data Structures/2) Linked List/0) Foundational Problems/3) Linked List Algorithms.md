 Some of the most common algorithms with linked lists that are often asked in coding interviews include:

 <br/>

| Algorithm                   | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linked List Traversal       | Traversing through a linked list to perform some operation on each node.                              |
| Insertion at Beginning      | Inserting a new node at the beginning of the linked list.                                              |
| Insertion at End            | Inserting a new node at the end of the linked list.                                                    |
| Insertion at Position       | Inserting a new node at a specific position in the linked list.                                        |
| Deletion at Beginning       | Deleting the first node of the linked list.                                                            |
| Deletion at End             | Deleting the last node of the linked list.                                                             |
| Deletion at Position        | Deleting a node at a specific position in the linked list.                                             |
| Reverse Linked List         | Reversing the order of nodes in a linked list.                                                         |
| Detecting Cycle             | Detecting if a linked list contains a cycle or is acyclic.                                             |
| Finding Middle Element      | Finding the middle element of a linked list.                                                           |
| Merging Two Sorted Lists    | Merging two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.                                       |
| Removing Nth Node from End  | Removing the nth node from the end of the linked list.                                                 |
| Intersection Point          | Finding the intersection point of two linked lists, if any.                                             |
