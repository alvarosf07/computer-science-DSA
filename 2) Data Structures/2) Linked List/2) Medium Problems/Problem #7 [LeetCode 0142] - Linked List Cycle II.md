# [LeetCode 142 - Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/)


## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.
Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.


Do not modify the linked list.


#### Example 1:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png" style="width: 370px;" />

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

#### Example 2:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" style="width: 200px;" />

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

#### Example 3:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" style="width: 50px;" />

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints:
  * The number of nodes in the list is the range <code>[0, 10^4]</code>.
  * <code>-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5 </code>
  * `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

#### Follow up: 
Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Solution 1 - Two Pointer Approach (Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm) (Hare-Tortoise Algorithm)
This method employs two pointers that move at different speeds. 
If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, confirming the cycle's existence.

#### Complexity:
  * Time: O(n)
  * Space: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
  def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, to the head of the linked list.
    slow = head
    fast = head

    # Move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps at a time through the linked list,
    # until they either meet or the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
    while fast and fast.next:
      slow = slow.next
      fast = fast.next.next
      if slow == fast:
        # If the pointers meet, there is a cycle in the linked list.
        # Reset the slow pointer to the head of the linked list, and move both pointers one step at a time
        # until they meet again. The node where they meet is the starting point of the cycle.
        slow = head
        while slow != fast:
          slow = slow.next
          fast = fast.next
        return slow

    # If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list without meeting the slow pointer,
    # there is no cycle in the linked list. Return None.
    return None      
```
