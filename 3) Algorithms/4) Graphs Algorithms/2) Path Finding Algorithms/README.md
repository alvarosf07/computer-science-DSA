# Path Finding Algorithms

Path finding algorithms are a class of algorithms used to find the shortest path or optimal route between two points in a graph or grid. These algorithms are commonly used in robotics, video games, geographic information systems (GIS), and network routing protocols.

## How Do Path Finding Algorithms Work?

Path finding algorithms work by exploring the possible paths between two points in a graph or grid and selecting the most efficient path based on certain criteria. The criteria can include factors such as distance, cost, or time.

## Key Features of Path Finding Algorithms:

1. **Efficiency:** Path finding algorithms aim to find the shortest or optimal path between two points in the most efficient manner possible.

2. **Flexibility:** Path finding algorithms can be applied to various types of graphs or grids, including weighted and unweighted graphs, directed and undirected graphs, and grids with obstacles.

3. **Applications:** Path finding algorithms have applications in robotics for navigation, video games for enemy AI and player movement, GIS for route planning, and network routing protocols for data transmission.

## When to Use Path Finding Algorithms:

Path finding algorithms are most commonly used in scenarios where:

- The goal is to find the shortest or optimal path between two points in a graph or grid.
- The environment is represented as a graph or grid with nodes (vertices) and edges (connections).
- The path must satisfy certain criteria, such as minimizing distance, cost, or time.

## Example of Path Finding Algorithm:

Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in a grid with obstacles. One approach is to use the A* algorithm:

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

def astar(grid, start, end):
    open_set = PriorityQueue()
    open_set.put((0, start))
    came_from = {}
    g_score = {node: float('inf') for row in grid for node in row}
    g_score[start] = 0
    while not open_set.empty():
        current = open_set.get()[1]
        if current == end:
            path = []
            while current in came_from:
                path.append(current)
                current = came_from[current]
            return path
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current):
            temp_g_score = g_score[current] + 1
            if temp_g_score < g_score[neighbor]:
                came_from[neighbor] = current
                g_score[neighbor] = temp_g_score
                f_score = temp_g_score + heuristic(neighbor, end)
                open_set.put((f_score, neighbor))
    return None

# Example usage:
grid = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
start = (0, 0)
end = (4, 4)
path = astar(grid, start, end)
print("Shortest path:", path)

```
