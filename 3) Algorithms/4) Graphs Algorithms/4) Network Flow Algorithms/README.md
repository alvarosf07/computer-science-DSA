# Network Flow Algorithms

> Network flow algorithms are a class of algorithms used to model and analyze the flow of resources or information through a network. These algorithms are commonly used in transportation, telecommunications, logistics, and computer networking.

## How Do Network Flow Algorithms Work?

Network flow algorithms work by representing a network as a graph, where nodes represent entities such as sources, sinks, and intermediate points, and edges represent connections between these entities. The algorithms then determine the optimal flow of resources or information through the network based on certain criteria, such as minimizing congestion or maximizing throughput.

## Key Features of Network Flow Algorithms:

1. **Optimization:** Network flow algorithms aim to optimize the flow of resources or information through a network by minimizing congestion, maximizing throughput, or satisfying certain constraints.

2. **Versatility:** Network flow algorithms can be applied to various types of networks, including transportation networks, communication networks, supply chain networks, and computer networks.

3. **Applications:** Network flow algorithms have applications in various fields, including routing and scheduling in transportation networks, data transmission in computer networks, resource allocation in supply chain networks, and capacity planning in telecommunications networks.

## When to Use Network Flow Algorithms:

Network flow algorithms are most commonly used in scenarios where:

- The goal is to optimize the flow of resources or information through a network.
- The network can be represented as a graph with nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent connections between entities.
- The analysis requires determining the optimal routing or allocation of resources based on certain criteria, such as minimizing costs or maximizing efficiency.

## Example of Network Flow Algorithm:

Consider the problem of finding the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a network. One approach is to use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:

```python
import networkx as nx

def ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink):
    return nx.maximum_flow(graph, source, sink)

# Example usage:
graph = nx.DiGraph()
graph.add_edge('source', 'A', capacity=10)
graph.add_edge('source', 'B', capacity=5)
graph.add_edge('A', 'C', capacity=7)
graph.add_edge('A', 'D', capacity=4)
graph.add_edge('B', 'C', capacity=3)
graph.add_edge('B', 'D', capacity=6)
graph.add_edge('C', 'sink', capacity=9)
graph.add_edge('D', 'sink', capacity=8)

max_flow, flow_dict = ford_fulkerson(graph, 'source', 'sink')
print("Maximum flow:", max_flow)
