# Node Ranking Algorithms: A Brief Introduction

> Node ranking algorithms are a class of algorithms used to assign ranks or scores to nodes in a graph based on various criteria. These algorithms are commonly used in social networks, search engines, recommendation systems, and network analysis.

## How Do Node Ranking Algorithms Work?

Node ranking algorithms work by analyzing the connectivity and properties of nodes in a graph and assigning ranks or scores to each node based on certain criteria. The criteria can include factors such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, PageRank, and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search).

## Key Features of Node Ranking Algorithms:

1. **Scalability:** Node ranking algorithms are designed to handle large-scale graphs efficiently, making them suitable for applications with massive datasets.

2. **Interpretability:** Node ranking algorithms provide insights into the importance or influence of nodes within a graph, aiding in decision-making and analysis.

3. **Applications:** Node ranking algorithms have applications in various fields, including social network analysis, web search, recommendation systems, and network security.

## When to Use Node Ranking Algorithms:

Node ranking algorithms are most commonly used in scenarios where:

- The goal is to identify important or influential nodes within a graph.
- The connectivity and structure of the graph play a significant role in determining node rankings.
- The analysis requires understanding the relative importance of nodes based on their connectivity and properties.

## Example of Node Ranking Algorithm:

Consider the problem of ranking web pages based on their importance in a web graph. One approach is to use the PageRank algorithm:

```python
import networkx as nx

def pagerank(graph):
    return nx.pagerank(graph)

# Example usage:
graph = nx.DiGraph()
graph.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)])
page_ranks = pagerank(graph)
print("Page ranks:", page_ranks)
